1. GBS Builds
=============

1.1. NON-SMACK Targets
----------------------

 gbs build -A [TARGET_ARCH]

1.2. SMACK enabled Targets
--------------------------

 gbs build -A [TARGET_ARCH] --define "%enable_dali_smack_rules 1"



2. Building for Ubuntu desktop
==============================

2.1. Minimum Requirements
------------------------

 - Ubuntu 14.04
 - Environment created using dali_env script in dali-core repository

2.2. Building the Repository
----------------------------

To build the repository enter the 'build/tizen' folder:

 cd dali-demo/build/tizen

Then run the following commands:

 cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$DESKTOP_PREFIX .
 make install -j8



3. Creating an example
======================

 - Make a directory in the "examples" directory. Only one example will be created per directory.
 - The executable installed will have a ".example" appended to it, e.g. a "blocks" directory produces "blocks.example".
 - Add all source files for the required example in this directory.
 - Modify "com.samsung.dali-demo.xml" to include your example so that it can be launched on target.
 - No changes are required to the make system as long as the above is followed, your example will be automatically built & installed.


4. Installing Emscripten Examples
=================================

Some Emscripten Javascript examples are included in dali-demo.

They do not require building, to install them run the provided install script.
Note: Your dali-env must be setup as it will install to your dali-env/opt/share/emscripten directory.

# cd ./emscripten-examples
# ./install.sh

Run the examples by either opening them in a browser, or, running the browser from the command line with an example as a parameter.
