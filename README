The dali-demo project contains examples using the the Dali API.
Within the directory structure, "examples" holds individual Dali example
programs, each one aimed at showing a particular API feature, and "demo"
contains a launcher application that can open those demos.
Additionally, the "stability" directory contains Dali applications
intended to exercise the the Dali APIs in an aggressive fashion.
They can be run by developers in automated builds to look for regressions,
and under a tool such as Valgrind to flush out leaks, memory corruption
and other errors
